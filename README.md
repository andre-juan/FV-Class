# FV-Class
Bioinformatics and machine learning frameworks designed to study FV-deficiency.

Source code and datasets coming soon. Stay tuned!

The protein is identidied by its code.

In this work, we study the **Factor V** (code: **7KVE**), although in the final paper we used a relaxed version of the structure, whose structure you can find [here](TO-DO: LINK 7kve_clean).
